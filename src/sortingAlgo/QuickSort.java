 * The key process in quickSort is partition().
 * Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, 
 * put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) 
 * before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. 
 * All this should be done in linear time.
